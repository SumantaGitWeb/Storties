                    <div x-show="chap1" class="text-emerald-500 Dongle text-3xl">Sakash hears a sound while sleeping. What was it? A YouTube video? A song? His alarm? It was his ALARM!! He suddenly gets up with a bang and rushes towards the bathroom. But as his fate, it was occupied. He and his sister were alone in the house. His father and mother went to the village due to some urgent work in the village. So he headed towards the brushing area. After brushing he used the bathroom. His sister was now being ready for their trip. Oh you don’t know what trip? They were also going to the village! Yes they would go through The Hyperloop! <br>

                        It was 7:40. He dressed up her sister as she was just an 8yr old now. But Sakash was a 14yr old. So they were all ready for their online classes. Yeah after the Era of covid-19 they still had to do online classes only. As that was habit of most students and teachers and the government also ruled the people as that was the new Constitution saying “That if Children go out to school the need of transport would be much and hence increasing Pollution!” So that was it, for now though. Well he forgot to cook food. So they ordered it around 7:56pm, and in 6mins it was there! Thanks to the newly built Hyperloop system which was built just 3months ago and it was the 1st in Mumbai and 2nd in the world and India!  And yeah they lived in Mumbai (I know you knew it, but as a narrator I had to tell it). So after having Breakfast wearing their glasses (blue ray protection ones) they were waiting for the zoom call. Sakash’s sister got one though but Sakash didn’t get one till now. It was 8:50 20 mins past their class timing. After contacting with his teacher it was clear. No class today. So after all the classes they had some light food as noodles (again…). Because they would first go to Kolkata to meet their uncle and have their lunch their and then go to Bhubaneswar, Orissa to their village. It would take them only 20 minutes to get their! Thanks to the Hyperloop system.

And the journey began. In 6mins they were in their village were another BetDo to their home! </div>

In their way home they were encountered by a deer that jumped on the road. To save it He turned the handle of the bike he was heading towards a tree and he crashed with the tree AND AND AND and ……… and he slowly opens his eyes to see a ceiling fan in front of his eyes. He listens that his mother who was trying to wake him up. He wakes up to see his home in Mumbai. He rushes towards the calendar and sees something. What was it…?? It was the year 2022!! (Well it was a dream...)
